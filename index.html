          <p>Most layouts used by responsive web pages can be categorized into one of five patterns: mostly fluid, column drop, layout shifter, tiny tweaks and off canvas. In some cases, a page may use a combination of patterns, for example column drop and off canvas. These patterns, originally identified by Luke Wroblewski, provide a solid starting point for any responsive page.</p>
          <p>This puppet seemed to be pretty cute in the pictures, but when I received it, I was disappointed. One of the eyes was sewn in funny, so that it looks like it isn't even there or has a black eye. Also, it doesn't fit an adult hand. It didn't fit my hand and I have a medium sized hand for a woman and didn't even come close to my husband's wrist. It is hardly even usable in other words. We were just expecting some high quality puppets for the price that they are asking and this is not what we got.</p>
